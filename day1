                  First i used ls command to list the files/items in th directory.
                  Then i used "cat" command to read the info in the readme file which i found by ls command .
                  i got the password for next level (level1 ->level2)
                  
                  
     level1 -> level2
            
             * The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory
             
             given info:
                    1.password from above level
                    2.file name : -
                    
           commands used:
                   1.ls
                   2.cat
           process :
                 the terminal is already in home directory so i just listed teh by file names by  "ls" command .
                 Then i used "cat ./-" to get password in - file .
                 
           why i used this "./"
                         if  i used "cat -" command : it replecated or copy what i have written in terminal .
                         here . represents the currrent folder/directory
                         and  ./ say the file is .. 
                         like   : ./filename               
    level2  -> level3
             
                *  The password for the next level is stored in a file called --spaces in this filename-- located in the home directory 
                 
                 given info :
                       1. filename: --space in the filename--
                       2.password from above level
                commands used
                        1.ls
                        2.cat
                 process:
                      as usal ls to list file names 
                      here the file name has spaces which terminal  take spaces different it doesn't take it has filename.
                      for that we use : "cat  ./"--space in the filename--"
                      
                      we know the ./ imply filename and we witr filename in quotes to tell its complete file name .
                      
                      we got password !!!!

               * The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.
                      
                      given info :
                               1. its a hidden file in inhere directory

                                3.cat
                      process:
                           First i changed th directory to inhere with cd command "cd inhere"
                           Then listed hidden files by "ls -a"
                           next priented teh password using cat : "cat ./.filename"
                           we got password !!!
    
    level4-> level5
             
               * The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command
                         
                       given info :
                              1.humna readable file in inhere directory.
                              2.password by above level.
                      commands used:
                            1.cd
                            2.file -- *
                            3.cat
                      process  ;
                           changed the directory to inhere
                           next i cat all the files present in it and i got password .
                           but the right way to do is to check the file type there are binary,data,oublic key,ASCII text 
                           therefore to check teh  type of file we use "file -- *" command
                           as per the type of data we cat the file .
                           human readable file= ASCII text
