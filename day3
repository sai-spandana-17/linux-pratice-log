              As per given info i used the command 
                 : ' find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c"
                 gave me lot of info but at a point it shoed me the path to a file 
                 then i printed that file with the help of given path and
                 found password!!
                 
                 
                 here / in find says that search from root directory.
                 
                 
                 
 level7 -> level8
 
     *The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth
     
     commands used:
            1.ls
            2.grep
            
      process:
            first i listed the files/directories present in it 
            then as per given info data.txt contains the password text to the word millionth
            i used teh command grep ."grep 'millionth' data.txt".
            and we found the password !!!
            
 
    level8 -> level9
       
         *The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once
           
               commmands used ;
                      1.sort
                      2.uniq
                      
             process;
                      There are too many password to find the correect on ein file 
                      which occured only once . 
                      I used "sort data.txt | uniq -u '
                      we got password!!!
                      
                      sort : sorts the lines 
                      uniq -u : prints the unique one deletes the  duplicate onces(adjecent)
                      
                      we would only used the uniq to find the "only once occured" but 
                      uniq only deletes the duplicates which i adjecent to it so if we sorted that first then use uniq 
                      we get answer.
