level12 ->level13

*The password fo r the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)
  
              commands used :
                           1.ls
                           2.mktemp -d
                           3.cd
                           4.mv
                           5.gunzip
                           6.bunzip2
                           7.tar

          process >> 
                          mktemp -d :to make random folder
                                  it looks like : tmp/tmp.cvss44w32
                         then change the directory where the random file is created:
                                 tmp/tmp.cvss44w32
                         now copying the original data from data.txt to rodomly created file "tmp/tmp.cvss44w32'
                                   cp  ~/data.txt .
                                          here ~ represents home directory where data.txt is present
                                          and . at end represents current directory
                         present the file is in hex form to convert it into normal file:
                                  xxd -r data.txt  > file1
                          now  see the file type by : "file filename"
                          if its gzip : 
                                 use mv filename.xx  filename.gz
                                 then , gunzip filename.gz
                          if its is bzip :
                              use  mv filename.xx  filename.bz2
                              then bunzip2 filename.bz2
                        if its tar:
                                 use tar -xf  filename
                                 
                        check teh file and use above commands to unzip the file repeatedly ,
                        untill the file type is   "ASCII text "
                        
                         at last after so many repeated steps we got passworddd...!!!!!
